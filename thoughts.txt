Task for now: Create parser for @DiscordSubCommand

What do I want from my Command/Permission system?

Other systems shouldn't need to know too much about it, ideally just use the @DiscordCommand(Sting name) annotation and register the comands that way
	- to register they Should just call a registerCommands(Object obj) function on some kind of CommandSystem object
		- how should the command system register the commands?
			a) all internally, commands are not seen outside at all
			b) get some object witch contains all the commands and register it with registerCommands() like everything else
	- what about a help command? 
		- where should it live?
		- needs access to all command names
	- what about a alias/rename system? [not in version 1.0]
		- where should it live?
		- needs access to all command names
		- does the permission system need to know about this?

Internally:

Command system and Permission system ideally are just loosly coppeled, so I can rework one system in the future if I want
The permission system needs read and write access to the commands.json file

Simple text response based commands should be in a seperate module, not the core command system
	-save these in the same file for easy acces to change the permissions and responses as the commands.json?
		pro: easier for an end user to edit
		con: couples this system togeter with the core command system
